Data Structures ? a way of storing and organizing data 
- we have methods provided for accessing and modifying the data structures 

## KEY VOC. 
1. Sequence : a way in which data is stored and accessed in a specific order 
2. Stack :  a linear data structure that follows the L.I.F.O principle 
3. Queue : a linear data structure that follows the F.I.F.O principle 
4. Index : location of an element in a sequence 
5. Iterable : able to be broken down into smaller parts of equal sizes and processed in turns i.e. loop , trasverse 
6. Slice : a group of neighbouring elements in a sequence 
7. List : a mutable (can be changed/reassigned) that can store many data types 
8. Tuple : Immutable data type that can store many data types 
9. Dictionaries : a linear data structure , Mutable data type used to store data in value and keys pairs
10. Sets : a data structure that is unordered , imutable , unindexed and do not allow duplicated values 
11. Range : a data type that stores integers in a fixed pattern 
12. String : a sequence of indexed characters.
13. Trees : non linear data structure that is hierarchial and composed of nodes which have values and can have zero or more child nodes 
14. Graphs : non linear data structure that is a collection of nodes connected by edges 
15. Linked Lists : a linear data structure in which elements are stored as individual nodes each containing a value and a reference 

## Use case 
- The Javascript DOM : tree
- Call Stack : (understand how functions work.) 
  - what is a stack overflow ?  Tech term : 
  - execution context 
  - return 
  - parameters and arguments
