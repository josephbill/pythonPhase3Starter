## concepts

- Variables 
- Variables Scope 
- Functions 
- Types of Functions in python
- BIG O Notation.+

## 

- Operators
1. Artithmetic : + , - , / , * , % 
2. Logical : and , or , not 
3. Assignment 

x = 10 
y = 5

x += y  # equivalent of x  = x + y 
x -= y
x *= y
x /= y
x %= y

- Conditional Flows 
if , elif , else 

- Control Flow statements 
1. Sequential control flow statements 
print("hello")
print("hello 2")
print("hello 3")

2. Conditional control flow 
if , elif , else 

3. Looping control Flows 
for loop , while loop

4. Nested control flow
Combine different control flows 


- Intro to Data Structures in Python 
- Common DS 
1. Sequences (Lists , Tuples , Ranges , Strings)
2. Dictionaries 
3. Sets 

DS : defination , accessing , mutable (changing process) , immutable (does a hack around exist.) , CRUD(ing)

- List Comprehensions


- Loops and relationship to BIG O notation. 


- For loops , while loops ,

= Loop operations : 
control statements : break, continue 
nested loops : outer loop , inner loop 


## Decorators (Object Oriented Programming)
- A concept in python that allows us to modify or extend the behaviour of functions or methods without 
directly modifying their code.  
- Tasks for decorators 
  1. Logging : displaying info. from the compilation process. 
  2. Input validation : 
  3. Authentication : modularity 

## Implementing decorators 
- They are implemented as functions.  
- They accept functions as an arguement , modify the function and then returns the modified function. 

- Functions are first class citizens ? they can be treated like any other object. i.e. being passed as arguments 
to other functions.
